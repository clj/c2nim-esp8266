# A c2nim for the ESP8266 SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clj/c2nim-esp8266.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clj/c2nim-esp8266)

A customised c2nim version for the [ESP8266 SDK](https://github.com/clj/nim-esp8266-sdk)

## Why

This is a poorly maintained set of hacks to make wrapping the [ESP8266
SDK](https://github.com/clj/nim-esp8266-sdk) a less manual task. Eventually it
will probably be better to stick with a vanilla c2nim, but for the moment this
is a quicker and less boring way to wrap the SDK.

## Installing

`nimble build`
