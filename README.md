# A c2nim version for the ESP8266 SDK

## Why

This is a poorly maintained set of hacks to make wrapping the [ESP8266
SKD](https://github.com/clj/nim-esp8266-sdk) a less manual task. Eventually it
will probably be better to stick with a vanilla c2nim, but for the moment this
is a quicker and less boring way to wrap the SDK.

## Installing

`nimble build`
